# Nova Operators for i-Gaming Content

## Core Transformation Operators

### Δ (Depth) - Essence Extraction
Strip marketing noise, preserve core meaning.
```
Input: "Experience the ULTIMATE thrill of our REVOLUTIONARY new slot!!!"
Output: "New slot game with enhanced bonus features"
```
- Remove hyperbole, excessive caps, exclamation abuse
- Extract factual claims (RTP, paylines, features)
- Preserve player value proposition

### ⊗ (De-cliché) - Fresh Phrasing
Replace overused gambling clichés.

| Cliché | Replacement |
|--------|-------------|
| "free spins" | "bonus rounds", "complimentary plays" |
| "instant win" | "immediate rewards", "quick payouts" |
| "jackpot" | "top prize", "maximum win" |
| "risk-free" | ❌ PROHIBITED (ΣLINT blocks) |
| "guaranteed" | ❌ PROHIBITED (ΣLINT blocks) |

### Ω (Structure) - Prose Flow
Convert bullet dumps to narrative prose.
- No "In the next section..." transitions
- Use proof-handshake for anxious readers before CTAs
- Natural paragraph flow, not list-heavy

### Σ (Segmentation) - Intent Sequencing
Organize by player journey:
1. **Discovery**: What is this game/offer?
2. **Decision**: Why should I try it?
3. **Action**: How do I start?

## Narrative Operators

### NAE.v1 (Narrative Archetype Engine)
Select storytelling frame:

| Archetype | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| Hero's Journey | VIP programs, loyalty rewards |
| Problem-Solution | Responsible gaming messaging |
| Discovery | New game launches |
| Social Proof | Player testimonials, reviews |

### ⊕TITLE_DOM - Title Dominance
Craft SEO-optimized headlines:
- Emotion hook + intent signal + semantic shape
- Vietnamese keyword integration (non-diacritic priority)
- Avoid regulatory red flags

```
Bad: "BEST CASINO BONUSES - WIN BIG NOW!!!"
Good: "Khuyến mãi casino tháng 1: Thưởng 100% nạp lần đầu"
```

## Distillation Packs

### MICRO_EXP (<60 words)
AIO snippet optimization. Mobile-first. Core value only.

### EXP-LITE (120-150 words)
Standard promo copy. One-pass distillation.
Pipeline: Δ→Σ→SRA→Ω→⊕TAN

### EXP (300-400 words)
Full game review. "Older sibling teaching" tone.
Pipeline: Δ→Σ→ψD→SRA→Ω→RCF→PPF→ΔEMOTION_POLARITY→NMO

## Pipeline Execution Order

```
1. Δ (extract essence)
2. Σ (segment by journey)
3. Ω (structure as prose)
4. ⊗ (de-cliché)
5. NAE (apply archetype)
6. VN_MAP (cultural adaptation)
7. EGM (ethics check)
8. SEO (title + meta optimization)
```

## Validation Operators

### E (Evidence)
All odds/claims require citations:
```
Claim: "RTP 96.5%"
Evidence: [Game provider documentation URL]
```

### ΣLINT
Auto-block prohibited phrases. See `ethical-guidelines.md`.
